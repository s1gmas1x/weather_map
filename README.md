# Weather Map (Leaflet + NOAA Radar)

## Overview
This project is a lightweight, browser-based weather visualization built with **Leaflet** and **Esri-Leaflet**. It displays **live NOAA radar imagery** and **National Weather Service (NWS) weather warnings** on an interactive map.

The goal of the project was to integrate real-time geospatial data from external services and present it in a clear, usable interface with minimal overhead.

## Why This Project
This project demonstrates:
- Consuming and displaying **real-time third-party geospatial data**
- Working with **mapping libraries and tile layers**
- Managing **layer controls and map state**
- Building a clean UI without a front-end framework
- Understanding how public APIs and GIS data sources are structured

It was intentionally kept framework-light to focus on fundamentals: data sources, rendering, and user interaction.
